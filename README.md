# Furnace

A terminal-first agentic coding harness. Built in the open, run it in your repository.

This is the landing page and documentation site for [Furnace](https://github.com/amoreX/furnace).

## Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) — build tooling
- [React](https://react.dev/) — UI library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) — client-side routing
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) — styling

## Getting started

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build       # production bundle in dist/
npm run preview     # serve the production bundle
npm test            # Vitest unit/component suite
npm run test:watch  # Vitest watch mode
npm run test:e2e    # full Playwright suite
npm run check       # unit tests, then production build
```

The changelog reads `src/releases.json` directly from the Furnace GitHub
repository at runtime and shows an explicit error if GitHub is unavailable.

## Architecture

`App.jsx` keeps the global background and chrome mounted while React Router
switches page content. Documentation imports Markdown as build-time raw text.
Files under `public/` retain root-relative URLs because WebGL textures and
feature data load them dynamically.

Canvas effects share one reference-counted pointer listener. Their render loops
pause when hidden or offscreen, respect reduced motion, redraw on relevant
theme/resize activity, recover WebGL context loss, and release observers,
listeners, texture loads, and GPU resources on unmount.

## Local simplification skill

Before behavior-preserving cleanup, read
`.cursor/skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md` and work review-first: understand
callers and tests, make only verified simplifications, and verify each change.
The skill is vendored from an immutable upstream revision; provenance and
update instructions are in `.cursor/skills/code-simplification/UPSTREAM.md`.
